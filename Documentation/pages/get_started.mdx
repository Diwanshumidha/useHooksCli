# Get Started

Congratulations! You're about to embark on the installation journey of Hooks Boost, and guess what? No need for wizardry or magic spells - we've made it as simple as telling a good joke!

```bash filename="bash" copy
 npx hooks-boost install
```

This command initiates the installation process and prompts you with a series of questions to tailor Hooks Boost to your preferences.

```bash
âˆš Are you using Typescript? no / yes

âˆš Where do you want to install Hooks? path: ./src/hooks
```

And just like that, you've set the stage for an enchanted React development experience!

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the installation journey without breaking a sweat. Hooks Boost has got you coveredâ€”no magical creatures harmed in the process!

Now go, my friend, and let the React magic unfold! ðŸŽ©âœ¨
